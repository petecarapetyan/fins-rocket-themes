# Rocket Themes (Fins)

This is a set of 18 "themes" for [Rocket SSG](https://rocket.modern-web.dev/)

If you're not familiar with [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) or SSGs in general, or more specifically the [JAMStack](https://jamstack.org/) trend with all 200+ implementations - the this all might be too foreign, but if you're already plugged into this world, these themes give that world a more of a WordPress-ish theme-like approach some validity.

## Running Examples of These Themes

Not every detail is finished, but they are all running and visible on the web

## Status:

Everything here is still pretty P.O.C. even if it's pretty nifty compared to what you can do elsewhere.

This project may be moving to [Fins](https://github.com/petecarapetyan/fins)eventually but for now it's here
