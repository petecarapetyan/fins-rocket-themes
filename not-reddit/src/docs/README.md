# not-reddit Rocket Theme

This is a theme for a [Rocket](https://rocket.modern-web.dev/) web site, loosely styled after the [reddit site](https://www.reddit.com/)

If you're already a Rocket user, then trying out this theme is pretty easy: Simply copy these three directories straight into your docs folder as you would any other rocket site modifications.

As in, check out this project and copypaste these three folders from `not-reddit/src/docs/`

- _assets
- _data
- _includes

There are also much fancier ways of trying out lots of different themes as outlined [here](https://webappwriter.com/rocket-themes/all/installation/), but the point is it's all pretty straighforward if you are already a rocket user.

## Who should use this theme

These themes are _**only for users who feel comfortable in HTML/CSS/JS**_ as some customization, or even completion of this theme is expected to be required.

## Customization

Probably start with `_data/site.cjs` but then take a look at all other files - there aren't that many.

## As customized and deployed

If you're looking for this theme as further personalized/customized and deployed on one of my sites:

- [as personalized/customized](https://github.com/petecarapetyan/btrg)
- [as deployed](https://www.btrg.org/)
